Git Merge allows us to merge branches of git, while the commit logs are intact. Git Rebase on the otherhand lets us integrate changes from one branch to another, and
once the action is complete, the commit logs are modified. Both combine the work of multiple people into a single folder/object. Merge preserves history, while Rebase 
rewrites it. Along with that, Merge is best when the resulting branch can be public, where as Rebase is best when the resulting branch is supposed to be private.

The remote repository is a central online repository that is seen by several collaborators.
